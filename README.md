Hi! I'm Joey, a Mechanical Engineering student on leave from Purdue with an interest in autonomous systems, controls, and robotics and a minor in economics. I'm currently working at @valstad-shipworks but I previously designed thermal solutions at AMD and researched subterranean robots to monitor soil microbiome health for the USDA.
